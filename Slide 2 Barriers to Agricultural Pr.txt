Slide 2: Barriers to Agricultural Productivity

Lack of Access to Land:

What are the primary reasons for limited access to land for agricultural purposes?
Who are the key stakeholders involved in land allocation and management?
How does land tenure insecurity impact agricultural productivity?


Insufficient Agricultural Skills and Knowledge:

What are the critical skills and knowledge gaps in the agricultural sector?
How do these gaps affect the efficiency and innovation within the sector?
Are there any existing initiatives addressing these skill shortages?



Limited Access to Resources and Support:

What resources and support are currently available from government and external agencies?
How accessible are these resources to smallholder farmers and agricultural businesses?
Are there any notable disparities in resource allocation across different regions or demographics?


For Slide Two:

1. Access to Land Visualization:
   - Map highlighting regions with the highest land scarcity or tenure insecurity, overlaid with data points representing youth population density and agricultural activity.
   - Venn diagram illustrating the intersection of factors contributing to limited access to land, such as financial constraints, gender disparities, and skills gaps.

2. Skill and Knowledge Gaps:
   - Radar chart comparing the proficiency levels of Nigerian youth in various agricultural skills (e.g., crop management, irrigation techniques, marketing) against ideal benchmarks.
   - Timeline infographic showing the evolution of government programs aimed at addressing skill gaps and their effectiveness over time.

3. Government Initiatives and Challenges:
   - Gantt chart depicting the timeline of government initiatives supporting smallholder farmers, with annotations highlighting key milestones and challenges encountered.
   - Word cloud representing the barriers faced by smallholder farmers in accessing government assistance, with the size of each barrier proportional to its significance.
